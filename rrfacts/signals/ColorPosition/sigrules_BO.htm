<H2>B&O Signals</H2> 
</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Baltimore and Ohio railroad used a unique <B>color-position</B> signal system that combined the use of colored lights with the semaphore simulation of the PRR / N&W position light type signals. Below is the master plan of a B&O signal. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="CP_master.GIF"><BR CLEAR=all></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The main signal head contains the color-position lights that show the equivalent of clear, approach, stop, or restricting. The following diagram shows the appearance of these signals for  each block condition.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="CP_basic.GIF"><BR CLEAR=all></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In addition to the main signal head there can be up to six auxillary lights above or below the main head and offset to the left or right of the main head. Very few signals have all six of the auxillary lights. 
<UL>
<LI>Most block signals only have one auxillary light, the center top one. 
<LI>Interlocking signals, and those signals approaching interlockings, usually have two or more of the auxillary lights but not all of them. 
<LI>On signals equipped with multiple auxillary lights only one auxillary light will be illuminated at any one time.
</UL>

<P>
The auxillary lights may seem to be arbitrary and confusing but they are not. The diagram below shows the master logic of the design. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="CP_logic.GIF"><BR CLEAR=all></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<OL>
<LI>If any one of the three auxillary lights in the top row are present and illuminated that allows normal speed through the block.
<LI>If any one of the three auxillary ights on the bottom row is present and illuminated that requires Medium Speed at <B>this</B> signal and the first word of the signal name will be <B>Medium</B>.
<LI>If either of the auxillary lights to the left of center are present and one illuminated that requires the train to be at Medium Speed at the <B>next</B> signal and the signal name will have <B>Approach Medium</B> in it.
<LI>If either of the auxillary lights to the the right of center are present and one illuminated that requires the train to be at Slow Speed at the <B>next</B> signal and the name will have <B>Approach Slow</B> in it.
<LI>If none of the auxillary lights are present, or are present but not illuminated, that requires Slow Speed at <B>this</B> signal and the first word of the signal name will be <B>Slow</B>.
</OL>

As seen in other signaling systems certain indications can be upgraded, bumped up to a less restricting aspect, by the flashing of lights. 
<UL>
<LI>The flashing of the top left auxillary light upgrades it from an Approach Medium to an Approach Limited.
<LI>The flashing of the bottom center auxillary light upgrades it from a Medium to a Limited.
<LI>The flashing of the two vertical green lights is a special case which upgrades it from a Slow Approach Slow to a Slow Clear.
</UL>

The main color-position head displays the block occupancy information. Occupied in this context means there may be a train, engine, cars or a hand throw switch not properly lined or a broken rail within the block.
<UL>
<LI>If the main head is Green (vertical) then this block is clear and the train will not have to stop at the next signal.
<LI>If the main head is Yellow (45 diagonal right) then this block is clear but the train must be prepared to stop at the next signal. The last word of this signal name will be "Approach".
<LI>If the main head is Red (horizontal) or Lunar White (45 diagonal left) then this block may be occupied. and/or hand throw switches may not be lined for the mainline.
</UL>

Now that we have the basic logic of the system the B&O color-position light signal rules shown below should not seem so arbitrary.

A green main head alone with no auxillary lights lit should be a Slow Clear. But if it were then there would be no way to display a Slow Approach Slow. So the B&O required that the green signal alone be flashing to display Slow Clear, and if not flashing it was a Slow Approach Slow.</TD>
